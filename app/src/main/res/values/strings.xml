    -------RUN_TEXT-------

    <string name="Run_Text_1">

      One of the simplest examples of a road map is planning for something like a marathon run.
	There are clear stages that lead up to this goal such as running 18miles, running a half marathon, running regularly, finding the time, Getting work and partner on board, doing the first run and maybe even buying shoes…


    </string>

    -------OVERCOMING_CHALLENGES-------


    <string name="overcoming_challenges_paragraph_one">
        In any plan there may be challenges. That is ok.
    </string>

    <string name="overcoming_challenges_paragraph_two">
        The key here is to focus on how to overcome those challenges instead of \"these are reasons why I should not do this\".

        On the next screen you will see your road map plan again with the

        hazard icons next to the steps you indicated may be a challenge.

    -------PROGRESS_CHECK-------


    <string name="ProgressCheck_paragraph_one">
        Ok so you have a clear goal, an understanding of why you want achieve it, a plan to achieve it and you have identified where the challenges may be.

    </string>

    <string name="ProgressCheck_paragraph_two">
        Now let\'s sense check this and get you started.


    </string>


    -------WHY-------

    <string name="Why_Text_one">
       It can help us understand\n our <b>motivation</b> to go deeper

    </string>


    <string name="Why_Text_two">
       For example: if you want a promotion and more money to afford a new house - keep asking yourself <u>WHY</u> do i want this?

    </string>

    -------WHY_GOALS_STATEMENTS_ARE_SO_IMPORTANT-------

    <string name="Why_So_Important_One">
      Goal statement are important because:
      They identify the real goal or WHY
      They often show other ways of achieving the ultimate or deeper goal.

    </string>


    <string name="Why_So_Important_2">
      For example in the goal statement above we can see that perhaps “getting promoted” is not the best way to achieve the “more money”, which enables “a house”, which enables a “new life with my partner”.
    </string>

    <string name="Why_So_Important_3">
      Perhaps what we should really be focussing on here is changing to a more lucrative career,  Moving to a different region or country, or focussing on our credit rating to enable a better mortgage offer.
    </string>


    -------BUILDING_A_ROADMAP_PLAN-------

    <string name="Building_a_roadmap_plan">
     Our next action is to build a set of steps that will help you achieve your goal. This is called a road map. Or more accurately a “reverse engineered road map”.

    </string>


    -------BUILDING_A_ROADMAP_PLAN_2-------

    <string name="Rd_map_plan">

       A good reverse engineered road map starts with your destination or goal. It then works backwards to identify each step that needs to take place in order to achieve the goal. It can also identify milestones and measurabes if you need it to. Next you will find two examples of road maps.

    ------CONFIDANT-------

    <string name="Confidant_1">

      It looks like you\'re not feeling that confident. That is OK.

    </string>


    <string name="Confidant_2">

      Think about why you have given this the rating you have and ask yourself these questions:

    </string>

    <string name="Confidant_question_1">

        1.) What…specifically…is the challenge here? - Why can\'t this be rated as an 9,8 or 10?\n\n
        2.) What can you do or put in place to make this challenge easier?\n\n
        3.) What would be the first step in doing that?\n\n
        4.) is there anyone who can help you?\n\n

    </string>


    <string name="Confidant_question_2">

        5.) Is there anyone you can think of who would find this much easier?\n\n


        6.)  What would the person you are thinking of do differently? Could you also do that?\n\n
              If not, is there anything you need to change so that you could do that?\n\n
        7.)  Are you missing any information?
             What else do you need to know?\n\n

            If so, what is the information and where can you go to get it?


    </string>

    ------RESPONDS-------

    <string name="Respons_1">

        <i> Are you absolutely sure that there is nothing that you could do to influence or improve the situation? Very rarely is there truly nothing we can do. – There is an old saying that ‘the only things in life that are certain are death and taxes’. This saying implies that these are the only things we can not truly change. But health gurus and accountants will agree that although you cannot stop death or taxes, - you can certainly influence them! Think again about your situation and focus on what you can do to influence or improve them. If you are still struggling with the idea that you can do anything to affect the situation, watch this short video… </i>
